## If using a Mac, use the following to install GEOS, GDAL, and PROJ.4 and DOCKER
1. Make sure your XCode is updated
2. Make sure you have Homebrew installed; if not, https://brew.sh/
3. Uninstall python using `brew uninstall --ignore-dependencies python`; the following will not successfully install postgis/gdal if you do not uninstall (if anyone finds a workaround for this, let me know!)
4. Go to https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/ref/contrib/gis/install/#homebrew and install
5. Install docker https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/
